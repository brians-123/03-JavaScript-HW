# Random Password Creator
Random Password Creator https://brians-123.github.io/03-JavaScript-HW/

## Description
This is homework for the third week of the UW/Trilogy coding bootcamp. This project will create a password generator which will be used by employees to generate a random password. The page will be responsive for multiple screen size. 
Criteria for the user to select is:
1. Number of characters from 1-128
2. Upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols

Validation will occur along the way to ensure:
1. The desired password size is a number and greater than 8 and less than 129
2. At least one character type is selected.
3. All of the character types have been generated. If not, ask the user to try again

When done, the screen will display the new password in the password text box without
being separated by commas.

## User Story
